` 1. Data Literacy `

Data literacy refers to the ability to read, understand, interpret, and use data effectively. 

**Data**: Raw facts, figures, or information collected for reference or analysis.

**Data Types**: 
1. Quantitative Data (Numerical Data): is numerical and used for calculations.
   
     Interval Data: Numerical data where the difference between values is meaningful, but there is no true zero point.
   
     Ratio Data: Numerical data that has all the properties of interval data, but with a true zero point, which allows for meaningful ratios.
   
2. Qualitative Data (Categorical Data): is descriptive and used for categorization.
   
     Nominal Data: Categories with no specific order.
   
     Ordinal Data: Categories that have a meaningful order or ranking but no consistent difference between them.
   
**Dataset**: A structured collection of data, often presented in rows and columns, like a table.

**Data Visualization**: The graphical representation of data to make it easier to understand, such as charts, graphs, and maps.
