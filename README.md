# Data Analyst and Data Science roadmap
` 1. Data Literacy `

Data literacy refers to the ability to read, understand, interpret, and use data effectively. 

**Data**: Raw facts, figures, or information collected for reference or analysis.

**Data Types**: 
1. Quantitative Data (Numerical Data): is numerical and used for calculations.
   
     Interval Data: Numerical data where the difference between values is meaningful, but there is no true zero point.
   
     Ratio Data: Numerical data that has all the properties of interval data, but with a true zero point, which allows for meaningful ratios.
   
2. Qualitative Data (Categorical Data): is descriptive and used for categorization.
   
     Nominal Data: Categories with no specific order.
   
     Ordinal Data: Categories that have a meaningful order or ranking but no consistent difference between them.
   
**Dataset**: A structured collection of data, often presented in rows and columns, like a table.

**Stages of Analytics**:

Descriptive Analytics: Focuses on understanding what has happened.

Diagnostic Analytics: Focuses on understanding why something happened.

Predictive Analytics: Focuses on anticipating what is likely to happen.

Prescriptive Analytics: Focuses on recommending actions to optimize outcomes.

**Data Visualization**: The graphical representation of data to make it easier to understand, such as charts, graphs, and maps.

**Population**: The population is the entire group of individuals or items that is the focus of a statistical study.

**Sample**: A sample is a subset of the population selected for analysis to make inferences about the entire group.

**Observation unit**: Observation unit is the individual entity or item on which data is collected and analyzed in a study.

**Central Tendency Measures**: These are values that summarize the data. Arithmetic mean, median, mode, and quartiles are measures of central tendency.

**Arithmetic Mean**: The arithmetic mean is the value obtained by adding all the values in a series and dividing by the number of values.

**Median**: The median is the value that divides a series into two equal parts when the series is arranged in ascending or descending order. It is the middle value in the ordered list.

   If the series is symmetric, meaning the values in the dataset are close to each other, it is appropriate to use the arithmetic mean as the representative value. However, if the series is not symmetric, the median should be preferred. If the arithmetic mean and median values are close to each other, the series is considered symmetric.

**Correlation**: A statistical measure that describes the extent to which two variables are related.

**Data Cleaning**: The process of preparing data by fixing or removing incorrect, incomplete, or duplicate data.

**Data Privacy**: Ensuring that personal or sensitive data is protected from unauthorized access.
